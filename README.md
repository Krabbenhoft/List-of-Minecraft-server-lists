# List-of-Minecraft-server-lists
List of websites that claim to give a list of good java servers. Aternos's list, for example, doesn't meet this requirement because it is more like a forum, and bedrock edition only sites are ignored as well. Things not marketed as lists are not included either. Specialized lists are also excluded.
